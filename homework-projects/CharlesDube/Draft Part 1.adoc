*Photo collage* is a graphical tool/application used to gather a user’s image gallery
data and make collage posters according to the user’s design or the results of the
inbuilt algorithm. This functionality is achieved through images being automatically
arranged to fill the poster design, and as the user, you can change the final layout,
dimensions, border or swap out photos. The final poster can be saved in any size.
